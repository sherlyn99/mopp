SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: test/data/1-1_t2_metaT_sub10_S37_L004_R1_001_250k.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 4.4
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 9166). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 26)
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
